# Titanic_Survival-Prediction
The Titanic Survival Prediction Project involves creating a model to predict the likelihood of passengers surviving the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, class and others. The goal is to leverage historical data to train a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a given passenger survived or not, using algorithms such as linear regression and random forests.
